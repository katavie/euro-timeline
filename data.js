        "summary": "Feudalism, developed in response to the need for protection of people and their lands, was the social and political system of medieval Europe. A system of mutual obligations defined by feudal contracts bound all members of society together. The monarch granted fiefs, or land, who then distributed them to lesser lords. Vassals, or people to whom fiefs were given, owed loyalty and military service to their lords in exchange for land and protection. Serfs and peasants worked on the land while receiving protection and shelter on their lord’s self-sufficient, isolated manor. The feudal system dominated Europe in conjunction with the manor economy for several centuries until various factors, including the Black Death, Crusades, and political changes in England and France, brought about its downfall."

        "long": 1,
        "summary": "The Renaissance, named for the French word meaning “rebirth”, was an era in Western Europe lasting from the 1300s to 1500s. Thinkers during the Renaissance drew upon ancient Greek and Roman ideas to create their own works. In stark contrast with the medieval focus on religion, these humanist philosophers emphasized the value and power of the individual. Study of the humanities, subjects such as history, grammar, poetry, and rhetoric, was important. Several factors enabled culture to flourish, particularly in Italy, home to the remnants of the Roman Empire. Due to its geographical location at the intersection of trade routes, Italy also received a wealth of knowledge from the Muslim civilization to its East. In the city-state of Florence, the immensely wealthy Medici family became major financial supporters, or patrons, of the arts. Lorenzo “the Magnificent” Medici frequently invited philosophers and poets to visit his palace. Artists were often polymaths, known as “Renaissance men”. Leonardo da Vinci, for example, was not only an extraordinary painter, but also made significant contributions to the fields of anatomy, engineering, and mathematics. In general, Renaissance art more closely reflected realistic life, with the help of techniques such as perspective and lighting. The Renaissance movement spread up to Northern Europe, where writers, most notably Sir Thomas More and William Shakespeare, produced influential works in the vernacular, or everyday language. A time of changing beliefs and culture, it marked the end of the Middle Ages and the transition to modern times."

        "summary": "In Wittenberg, Germany, Johann Tetzel sold indulgences to raise funds for the Cathedral of St. Peter in Rome. Indulgences granted guaranteed entry to heaven for the holders and their relatives. Martin Luther, outraged by this incident and general corruption in the Church, wrote 95 Theses against indulgences. Luther argued that indulgences were essentially scams with no biblical basis, and that eternal life and happiness could only be attained through faith. With the power of the printing press, the 95 Theses were rapidly spread across Europe. When called to recant, Luther’s beliefs became increasingly radical to the point where he was excommunicated by Pope Leo X in 1521. Luther was summoned by the Holy Roman emperor, Charles V, to the diet, or assembly of German princes, in Worms. Though he was declared an outlaw for repeatedly refusing to give up his views, Luther’s work sparked a religious revolution known as the Protestant Reformation. Many sects of Christianity formed, each differing from the Catholic Church. Lutheranism, for example, rejected some Catholic sacraments, and Calvinism was led by a council of elders, as opposed to the Pope. These changes incited conflicts through Europe and Germany. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was passed, letting each German prince decide whether Catholicism or Lutheranism would be the religion of their land. This was a stark difference from before, where Europe was dominated entirely by Catholicism."

        "summary": "For several generations, England had been ruled by monarchs from the Tudor house, known for collaborating with Parliament. Henry VIII, though infamous for his many wives, consulted the legislative body in order to declare himself the head of the Anglican Church in the Act of Supremacy. Elizabeth I, who earned the nickname “Good Queen Bess”, had advisors who facilitated communication between her and Parliament. A series of rulers from the Stuart family succeeded the Tudors, and a multitude of political changes occurred during their reign. James I constantly requested money from Parliament not only to finance wars, but also to upkeep his lavish lifestyle and court. He opposed the Puritans, who strove to eliminate Catholic tradition from the Church of England. Charles I acted like an absolute monarch, going so far as to entirely dissolve Parliament and attempt to revive Catholic practices. In response to this, a group called the Long Parliament formed. Beginning in 1642, Charles led his Cavaliers against the Roundheads, who were led by Oliver Cromwell and who fought for Parliament. Charles’ execution in 1649 was a great shock to the rest of Europe, signalling major political changes to occur throughout the continent in the future. The House of Commons declared England a republic, called the Commonwealth, ending the English Civil War in 1651. The conflicts, however, were not yet over. The strict rules resulting from strong Puritan influence in the Commonwealth upsetted the people until the Glorious Revolution, during which the monarchy was restored."

        "summary": "For centuries, French society had been dictated by the ancien regime, separating the citizens into three estates. The First and Second Estates, consisting of the clergy and nobility, respectively, composed less than 3% of the population. The Third Estate, despite its magnitude, held little to no political power. The bourgeoisie, which included bankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, and professors, were relatively well-off, but the vast majority of the population starved and struggled to survive. Meanwhile, the government was in debt and ignored the plight of its poor. Louis XIV had borrowed large sums of money to finance the Seven Years’ War and the American Revolution. Combined with the rise of prices, as well as Louis XV’s focus on pleasure and deficit spending, the government was well in debt by the time Louis XVI took the throne. French nobles, who sought to extend their power over the absolute monarch, urged Louis XVI to summon the Estates-General, a legislative body with representatives from each of the Estates. Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General for the first time in over 175 years. Each of the estates wrote down their grievances in cahiers, or notebooks. After weeks of meeting, the Estates-General had made little progress. Finally, the Third Estate delegates declared themselves as the National Assembly, representing the whole population of France. They were locked out of the halls, so they moved to a handball court, where they made the Tennis Court Oath. Some clergy and nobles sided with the National Assembly, prompting the king to reluctantly accept it. However, Louis stationed royal troops in Paris. On July 14, 1789, citizens stormed the Bastille, a prison, in search of weapons. While there were no arms to be found, the attacking of the Bastille became a symbol of the French people rising up against their oppressive government and the beginning of the French Revolution. Today, July 14 is celebrated as Bastille Day, the French Independence Day."

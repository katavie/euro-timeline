        "long": 1,
        "summary": "Feudalism, developed in response to the need for protection of people and their lands, was the social and political system of medieval Europe. A system of mutual obligations defined by feudal contracts bound all members of society together. The monarch granted fiefs, or land, who then distributed them to lesser lords. Vassals, or people to whom fiefs were given, owed loyalty and military service to their lords in exchange for land and protection. Serfs and peasants worked on the land while receiving protection and shelter on their lord’s self-sufficient, isolated manor. The feudal system dominated Europe in conjunction with the manor economy for several centuries until various factors, including the Black Death, Crusades, and political changes in England and France, brought about its downfall."

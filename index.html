            <p class="summary">The gradual decline of the Roman Empire was marked with political instability as emperors were assassinated quickly after taking the throne. Reforms by Emperors Diocletian and Constantine failed to solve the socioeconomic problems threatening the empire. In 476, Odoacer, a Germanic leader, expelled the Roman emperor, signalling the formal “fall” of the Rome to foreign invaders.</p>

            <h2>Feudalism Develops</h2>
            <p class="summary">Feudalism, developed in response to the need for protection of people and their lands, was the social and political system of medieval Europe. A system of mutual obligations defined by feudal contracts bound all members of society together. The monarch granted fiefs, or land, who then distributed them to lesser lords. Vassals, or people to whom fiefs were given, owed loyalty and military service to their lords in exchange for land and protection. Serfs and peasants worked on the land while receiving protection and shelter on their lord's self-sufficient, isolated manor. The feudal system dominated Europe in conjunction with the manor economy for several centuries until various factors, including the Black Death, Crusades, and political changes in England and France, brought about its downfall.</p>

            <h2>The Great Schism</h2>
            <p class="summary">Christian practices differed between Western Europe and the Byzantine Empire, causing rising tensions. The use of icons, criticized as "graven images", was temporarily outlawed, sparking violent battles that led to the Great Schism, resulting in a separation of the Eastern, or Greek, Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church. The Roman pope and Byzantine patriarch excommunicated each other.</p>

            <h2>Crusades Begin</h2>
            <p class="summary">Byzantine emperor Alexius I asked Pope Urban II for assistance in fighting Muslim Seljuk Turks in order to regain access to the Christian Holy Land. At the Council of Clermont in 1095, Urban rallied clergy, knights, and ordinary people, who fought in a total of four campaigns. Ultimately, the Crusades resulted in religious hatred, but also expanded the worldview of Europeans.</p>

            <p class="summary">King John of England was an unpopular monarch who became enemies with King Philip II of France, Pope Innocent III, and the English nobles.
